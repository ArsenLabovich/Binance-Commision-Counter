# Binance-Fee-Tracker

Application that helps you to analyze your fees on Binance. The application provides a simple UI and encrypted local keys storage.

## Important Notice
**Do not share your API and secret keys with strangers!**

## Requirements
The application needs Binance API and secret key to see your trades (only read field is necessary).

## Guide to Get Your Keys and Use the Application
1. Go to Binance --> Dashboard --> Account --> API Management
2. Create API
3. System Generated
4. Type any name for your key
5. Verify yourself
6. Select only read
7. Save the secret key, Binance provides it only while the key is created, you can't see it anymore

Now you can use keys in the application.

## Instructions
1. Copy and paste your keys into the fields.
2. Press the right button and wait about 1-2 minutes.

Such a long time is because of Binance API limit of 3600 requests per minute and the application needs to check all trades on your account.
