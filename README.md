# Binance-Fee-Tracker
Application that helps you to analyze your fees on Binance.
Applications provides Simple UI and Encrypted local keys Storage.
# !!!Do not share your API and Secret keys to strange people!!!
# Application need Binance API and Secret Key to see your trades ( only read field is neccessary)


Guide to get your keys and use.

1) Go to Binance --> Dashboard --> Account --> API Managment
2) Create API
3) System Generated
4) Type any name for your key
5) Verify yourself
6) Select only read
7) Save Secret Key, Binance provides it only while key is created, you can't see it anymore

Now you can use keys in my application.

Copy and Paste them into fields, press right button and wait about 1 - 2 minutes

Such long time is becouse of Binance API limit of 3600 requests per minute and Application need to check all trades between all trades on your account
